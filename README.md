# branchwise

Branch-scoped memory and sessions for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code). Isolate conversation context per git branch — no more memory pollution across features, bugfixes, and experiments.

## Problem

Claude Code's built-in memory is scoped per repository, not per branch. When you work across multiple branches, debugging notes from a bugfix bleed into feature work, and architectural decisions from one feature get incorrectly applied to another. And `claude --continue` resumes the most recent session globally — not the one from your current branch.

**Branchwise** gives each git branch its own memory and session tracking. Memory auto-loads when you start a session, switches when you change branches, and `--continue` resumes the right branch's conversation.

## How It Works

```

~/.claude/branch-memory/<project-hash>/
  .sessions/
    main                  ← session ID (plain text)
    feat%2Fauth-flow
  branches/
    main.md               ← memory entries (markdown)
    feat%2Fauth-flow.md

      abc1234.md
```

Three layers:
1. **Hooks** — Auto-load memory at session start; detect mid-session branch switches; track session IDs
2. **MCP Server** — 5 tools Claude can call to read/write/manage branch memory
3. **CLI + `bw` wrapper** — Manual operations and branch-aware `--continue`

Plus **auto-save**: Claude proactively saves important decisions, debug findings, and patterns without you asking.

## Install

```bash
npm install -g branchwise
```

### Configure Claude Code

Add the MCP server to your project's `.mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "branchwise": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "branchwise"]
    }
  }
}
```

Add hooks to `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash $(npm root -g)/branchwise/hooks-handlers/session-start.sh",
            "timeout": 5
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "UserPromptSubmit": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash $(npm root -g)/branchwise/hooks-handlers/prompt-submit.sh",
            "timeout": 3
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Enable branch-scoped sessions

Add this alias to your shell profile (`~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`):

```bash
alias claude='bw'
```

Now `claude --continue` and `claude -c` automatically resume the correct branch's session. All other flags pass through to the real `claude` binary untouched.

**How it works:** The SessionStart hook captures each session's ID and stores it per branch. When you run `claude --continue`, the `bw` wrapper looks up the stored session ID for your current branch and calls `claude --resume <id>` instead. If there's no stored session, it falls back to normal `--continue` behavior.

## Usage

### Automatic (zero effort)

Just start a Claude Code session. Branchwise automatically:
- Loads memory for your current branch
- Tracks the session ID for later `--continue`
- Detects when you `git checkout` to another branch mid-session
- Injects the new branch's memory into context
- Saves important decisions and findings as you work

### In conversation

Ask Claude to remember things for the current branch:

```
> Remember that we decided to use Zod for validation in this feature
> [Claude calls remember_for_branch]
Saved to branch memory for "feat/auth": [decision] Use Zod for validation
```

Claude can also read branch memory:

```
> What do we know about this branch?
> [Claude calls recall_branch_memory]
## Branch Memory: feat/auth
- [2025-03-15 14:30] [decision] Use Zod for validation
- [2025-03-15 15:00] [debug] Auth middleware requires session token in cookie, not header
```

### MCP Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `remember_for_branch` | Save a memory entry for the current branch |
| `recall_branch_memory` | Read all entries for a branch |
| `list_branch_memories` | List all branches with stored memory |
| `forget_branch_memory` | Delete a branch's memory |
| `gc_branch_memories` | Clean up memories for deleted branches |

### CLI

```bash
branchwise list              # All branches with memory
branchwise show [branch]     # Show memory (default: current branch)
branchwise add "entry"       # Add entry to current branch
branchwise clear [branch]    # Clear a branch's memory
branchwise gc                # Remove memories for deleted branches
branchwise session           # Show stored session ID for current branch
branchwise session --all     # Show all branch → session mappings
branchwise session --clear   # Remove session mapping for current branch
```

## Storage

```
~/.claude/branch-memory/
  a1b2c3d4e5f6/              # SHA-256 hash of git common dir (first 12 chars)
    _meta.json                # { repoPath, createdAt }
    .current-branch           # Tracks branch for switch detection
    .sessions/
      main                    # Session ID for branch (plain text)
      feat%2Fauth-flow        # URI-encoded branch name
      _detached_abc1234       # Detached HEAD session
    branches/
      main.md                 # One markdown file per branch
      feat%2Fauth-flow.md     # "/" URI-encoded as "%2F" (fully reversible)
      _detached/
        abc1234.md            # Detached HEAD keyed by commit SHA
```

- Max 200 lines per branch (oldest entries trimmed on overflow)
- Human-readable markdown files
- Atomic writes with temp file + rename (safe for concurrent access)
- Lock file protection to prevent trim race conditions
- Symlink-safe: all file operations validate paths and skip symlinks
- Separate from Claude Code internals (`~/.claude/projects/`)
- Worktree-safe: uses `git rev-parse --git-common-dir` to normalize

## Security

- **Path traversal**: Branch names encoded with `encodeURIComponent`; detached HEAD SHAs sanitized with `basename()`
- **Symlink attacks**: All reads/writes/deletes use `lstatSync` to detect and skip symlinks; `realpathSync` validates paths stay within storage directory
- **Argument injection**: Session IDs validated against `^[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9_-]{7,63}$` — must start with alphanumeric, preventing `--flag` injection
- **Shell injection**: No user input interpolated into shell commands; git helpers use `execSync` with hardcoded commands and `cwd` option
- **JSON injection**: Hook output escapes all control characters (U+0000–U+001F) per JSON spec
- **Input validation**: Zod schemas enforce max lengths (10K for entries, 500 for branch names)
- **Race conditions**: Atomic rename for file trimming; exclusive lock file prevents concurrent trim corruption

## Edge Cases

| Scenario | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| Detached HEAD | Keyed by short commit SHA under `_detached/` |
| Branch rename | Memory stays under old name; `branchwise gc` detects orphans |
| Branch delete | Memory persists on disk; `branchwise gc` cleans up |
| Git worktrees | All worktrees of same repo share memory (normalized via git common dir) |
| No git repo | Gracefully no-ops |
| Detached HEAD GC | Auto-cleaned after 30 days |
| No stored session | `bw` falls back to normal `claude --continue` |
| Non-git directory | `bw` passes through to `claude` unchanged |
